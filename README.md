# FoodTrail-website-Using-HTML-CSS-JS-and-bootstrap
The website was a virtual map, dotted with pins representing street food stalls and markets from every corner of the world. Each pin was a gateway to a story, complete with vibrant photos, detailed descriptions, and even videos of the vendors at work. But FoodTrail was more than just a directory; it was an immersive experience.

All pages have their desired css and js files...
Some pages may not have...but the css is included in the head tag
